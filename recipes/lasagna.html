            <br> <h2>Description</h2>
            <br>Lasagna is a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagna, or the singular lasagna, is also an Italian dish made of stacked layers of this flat pasta alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce) and other vegetables, cheese (which may include ricotta and parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with melted grated mozzarella cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagna casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.
