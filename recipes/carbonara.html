        <br> <h2>Description</h2>
        <br>Carbonara is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper. It is typical of the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century. The cheese is usually pecorino romano. The eggs are used to create a creamy sauce. The way the eggs are mixed with the cheese is what gives the dish its creaminess. The heat of the pasta cooks the eggs and the cheese to create a smooth sauce. The pork is cooked in fat, which may be olive oil, lard, or bacon fat. The pasta is cooked, then mixed with the hot pork fat to cook it. The egg and cheese mixture is added to the hot pasta to create the sauce. The dish is usually topped with more cheese and black pepper
        <br><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
                <li>2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced
                    <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)
                        <li>2 large eggs
                            <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
                                <li>1 pound spaghetti pasta
                                    <li>Salt
                                        <li>Black pepper
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br><h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the pasta water:
                Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)
                <li>Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic:
                    While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.
                    
                    Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.
                    <li>Beat the eggs and half of the cheese:
                        In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.
                        <li>Cook the pasta:
                            Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.
                            <li>Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon:
                                When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.
                                
                                Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
                                
                                Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)
                                <li>Add the beaten egg mixture:
                                    Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.

        </ol>
